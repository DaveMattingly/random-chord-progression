## Random Chord Progression Generator
This tool generates a random chord progressing in C Major, based upon data provided by [Hooktheory Trends](https://www.hooktheory.com/trends).

The tool uses a seeded random generator, allowing you to save a seed and regenerate it later if you find a progression that you like.

While it's unlikely that an entire progression will sound good, my hope is that a chord transition or two could inspire further composition.
